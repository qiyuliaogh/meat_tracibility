# Improving Traceability and Quality Control in the Red-Meat Industry Through Computer Vision-Driven Physical Meat Feature Tracking

## Abstract

This paper explores the application of CMOS imaging and computer vision technologies to enhance traceability and quality control in the red meat industry. We propose a novel computer vision-based traceability pipeline using internal, immutable meat features, achieving an F-1 score of 0.9942 in sample-to-sample tracing and 0.9479 in sample-to-database tracing, significantly increasing resistance to fraud. Based on the EfficientNet model, our method enables highly confident verification of provenance details, such as diet (90.90% accuracy) and breed (91.23% accuracy). It also improves product quality assessment through objective measures like marbling score prediction, achieving 96.24% top-1±1 and 99.57% top-1±2 accuracy. To support this research, we introduce a new comprehensive image dataset containing 38,528 high-resolution beef images taken from 602 steaks, specifically designed for traceability and quality control of beef. This innovative approach offers robust protection against product substitution, empowers end-users to authenticate product credentials, and enhances objective quality reporting. Ultimately, the proposed technology and dataset aim to strengthen consumer trust and integrity within the red-meat supply chain.
